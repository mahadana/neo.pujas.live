The `fixtures` directory contains fixtures (snapshots) of HTML and API responses
for use in tests. This helps speed up the tests and aids with debugging. The
directory can be removed and tests re-run to re-generate the snapshots.

Note: HTML fixtures are modified to be smaller and easier observe differences
via version control. It currently does not present a problem, although this may
change in the future!
